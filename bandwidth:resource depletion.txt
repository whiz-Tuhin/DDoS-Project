* There are two main classes of DDoS attacks : bandwidth depletion and resource depletion attacks. 
	* A bandwidth depletion attack is designed to flood the victim network with unwanted traffic that prevents legitimate traffic from reaching the primary victim. 
		- In this project I will be demonstrating a UDP Flood Attack:
			+ In a UDP Flood attack, a large number of UDP packets are sent to either random or specified ports on the victim system. The victim system tries to process the incoming data to determine which applications have requested data. If the victim system is not running any applications on the targeted port, it will send out an ICMP packet to the sending system indicating a "destination port unreachable" message

	* A resource depletion attack is an attack that is designed to tie up the resources of a victim system making the victim unable to process legitimate requests for service.
		- Protocol Exploit Attacks: Given two examples, one misusing the TCP SYN (Transfer Control Protocol Synchronize) protocol, and the other misusing the PUSH+ACK protocol.
			+ In a DDoS TCP SYN attack, the attacker instructs the bots to send bogus TCP SYN requests to a victim server in order to tie up the serverâ€™s processor resources, and hence prevent the server from responding to legitimate requests. The TCP SYN attack exploits the three-way handshake between the sending system and the receiving system by sending large volumes of TCP SYN packets to the victim system with spoofed source IP addresses, so the victim system responds to a non-requesting system with the ACK+SYN. When a large volume of SYN requests are being processed by a server and none of the ACK+SYN responses are returned, the server eventually runs out of processor and memory resources, and is unable to respond to legitimate users.
			+ In a PUSH + ACK attack, the attacking agents send TCP packets with the PUSH and ACK bits set to one. These triggers in the TCP packet header instruct the victim system to unload all data in the TCP buffer (regardless of whether or not the buffer is full) and send an acknowledgement when complete. If this process is repeated with multiple agents, the receiving system cannot proces
